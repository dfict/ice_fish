Ice Cold

Welcome.  This is the repository containing code and OSH files for the solar sounder known as Ice Fish. It's a solar-powered, temperature and light controlled board. you can buy the circuit board, soon, at <a href="https://monadmonad.square.site/">my ghost company, Monad</a>. It also will work on vanilla Arduino UNO but you'll need to provide peripherals such as temp sensor, amp, etc. 

More details coming soon!
